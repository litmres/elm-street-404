# 404 Elm Street

![Screencast](screen.gif)

You are Joe, the courier. It is your job, to deliver *all* the fashion to *all* the customers. Sometimes, you have to pick up stuff and return it to a warehouse.

No problem.

However, customers keep ordering more and more — and your bicycle only has room for so many boxes...

To succeed, you'll have to plan your route carefully. You have to decide which packages to deliver in which order. And you really, really have to hurry.

Unhappy customers: **you lose**.

This game has been created by [@w0rm](https://github.com/w0rm), [@kolja](https://github.com/kolja), [@aryszka](https://github.com/aryszka) and [@vigneshshanmugam](https://github.com/vigneshshanmugam) at [Zalando Hackweek](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/blog/using-elm-to-create-a-fun-game-in-just-five-days/). It could be seen on the 404 page of Zalando website, but then it was removed from there. As the top contributor, I feel that there is no reason to support it on Zalando GitHub, so I made this fork!
